# Introduction 
This is a repository for a small  basic level API design of blog website wherein user can register, login, post blogs, post comments,edit and delete blogs.

# Getting Started
TODO: Please clone this repo and you can hit the api since the database is hosted on azure database server:
1.	If you are not able to access the database server due to some privacy restrictions I have provided the db script so that you can set up the db in local host and replace the connection string in the app settings file
2.	Register a user
3.	Get the JwT token by logging
4.	Hit the APIs with jwt bearer token as auth
